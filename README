If you have used Google, eBay, Bing or any major commercial search engine, then its likely that you have used autocomplete functionality. Autocomplete is a powerful
feature which offers suggestions for query completion as user types his/her query. It enhances user experience and is especially useful while using mobile devices as it is not easy to type on mobile.

In this lab we will build autocomplete feature by applying what we have learned today about language models. We are going to use completion suggester in elastic search for building this feature. We will also use KenLM as the language model library for this project. 

Instructions
(1) Install Elastic Search
(2) Install Docke
	run "Docker run -it utkarshp/kenlm"
	KenLM is already installed in this image
(3) Download norvig.com/big.txt
	We will train our language model on this
(4) Download http://boston.lti.cs.cmu.edu/Data/web08-bst/AOLQs.txt
	We will use these queries to index for suggestions
